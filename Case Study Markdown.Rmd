```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



Beginning by loading any necessary packages

```{r initialize}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(lubridate)
```

Next, the data from the csv needs to be imported

```{r import csv}
sp500 <- fread(E:\\Documents\\sp500_options_2010.csv)

sp500 <- sp500 %>%
  mutate(
    STRIKEPRICE = STRIKEPRICE / 1000,
    MID_PRICE = (ASK_PRICE + BID_PRICE) / 2
  )
```
